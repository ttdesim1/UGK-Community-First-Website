# UGK-Community-First-Website

Date: October 2020 – November 2020 

The goal of this academic project was to redesign The Underground Kitchen's Community First website 
to include their new Roslyn Program. WordPress was used to create mock website based off of their 
current website. The website’s color scheme was redesigned by utilizing the Pantone 2021 Spring color trend 
report and incorporating new UGK brand images.
